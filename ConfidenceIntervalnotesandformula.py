## Statistical Inference with Confidence Intervals

# Throughout week 2, we have explored the concept of confidence intervals, how to calculate them, interpret them, and what confidence really means.  

# In this tutorial, we're going to review how to calculate confidence intervals of population proportions and means.

# To begin, let's go over some of the material from this week and why confidence intervals are useful tools when deriving insights from data.

# ### Why Confidence Intervals?

# Confidence intervals are a calculated range or boundary around a parameter or a statistic that is supported mathematically with a certain level of confidence.  For example, in the lecture, we estimated, with 95% confidence, that the population proportion of parents with a toddler that use a car seat for all travel with their toddler was somewhere between 82.2% and 87.7%.

# This is *__different__* than having a 95% probability that the true population proportion is within our confidence interval.

# Essentially, if we were to repeat this process, 95% of our calculated confidence intervals would contain the true proportion.

# ### How are Confidence Intervals Calculated?

# Our equation for calculating confidence intervals is as follows:

# $$Best\ Estimate \pm Margin\ of\ Error$$

# Where the *Best Estimate* is the **observed population proportion or mean** and the *Margin of Error* is the **t-multiplier**.

# The t-multiplier is calculated based on the degrees of freedom and desired confidence level.  For samples with more than 30 observations and a confidence level of 95%, the t-multiplier is 1.96

# The equation to create a 95% confidence interval can also be shown as:

# $$Population\ Proportion\ or\ Mean\ \pm (t-multiplier *\ Standard\ Error)$$

# Lastly, the Standard Error is calculated differenly for population proportion and mean:

# $$Standard\ Error \ for\ Population\ Proportion = \sqrt{\frac{Population\ Proportion * (1 - Population\ Proportion)}{Number\ Of\ Observations}}$$

# $$Standard\ Error \ for\ Mean = \frac{Standard\ Deviation}{\sqrt{Number\ Of\ Observations}}$$

# Let's replicate the car seat example from lecture:

import numpy as np

tstar = 1.96
p = .85
n = 659

se = np.sqrt((p * (1 - p))/n)
se

lcb = p - tstar * se
ucb = p + tstar * se
(lcb, ucb)

import statsmodels.api as sm

sm.stats.proportion_confint(n * p, n)

# Now, lets take our Cartwheel dataset introduced in lecture and calculate a confidence interval for our mean cartwheel distance:

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("Cartwheeldata.csv")

df.head()

mean = df["CWDistance"].mean()
sd = df["CWDistance"].std()
n = len(df)

n

tstar = 2.064

se = sd/np.sqrt(n)

se

sm.stats.DescrStatsW(df["CWDistance"]).zconfint_mean()

lcb = mean - tstar * se
ucb = mean + tstar * se
(lcb, ucb)
